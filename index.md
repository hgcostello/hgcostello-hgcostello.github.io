My first exposure to the power of data science came my Sophomore year of high school. Jared Cross, my statistics teacher, was working on a model for projecting mlb player performance. (Steamer Projections... look it up!) He was young, had mutton chops, a great teacher -- pretty much the ideal person to look up to. He took a few of us under his wing and helped us study for the Stats AP.

My next exposure to data science was, of course, Intro to Comp Sci Freshman year of college, 2014. Not much to say about that.

I took some more statistics and math classes and I had an internship at the MLB Player's Association where my title was, technically, "Data Analytics Intern". That's what happens when you let lawyers manage the hiring process for a technical position. 

Fast-forward six or seven years and I am returning to these early exposures to data science. My passion has always been the humanities. Writing, reading, soft-skills. But there is only so much you can do with these things. I am excited to have the POWER at my finger tips-- the ability to not just ask smart and important questions, and specualate on their answers, but to answer them convincingly.

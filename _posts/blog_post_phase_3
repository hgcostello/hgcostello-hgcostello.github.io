If you didn't think math was hard enough... and I did... then try data science.

There is a beauty to mathematics that many find attractive. I did in junior high, and then high school, and then the first two/three years of college. Formulas, repetition, symmetry, graphical representation, the finality of proofs. As you go along, things necessarily become more abstract. This isn't unique to the field of mathematics, but it's something to contend with all the same. A 2D graph? X and Y? We all can visualize that relationship. 3 Dimensional relationships are ok, too. We live in that space, of course we can close our eyes and imagine it. Now, picture a 20D graphical relationship, all the accompanying ways of representing it and the rules that follows (matrices, systems of equations, partial derivatives, and so on.) Not fun. Yes, the same rules apply in 20D that applied in 2D, and that can be satisfying. But many of us are lost once we move beyond what can be represented visually.

I am venting, if that was not clear. But these are some of the things you have to become comfortable with as a data scientist.
